She was on birth control pills, which she had been taking for the past 18 years. She is neither smoker nor substance abuser. At the time of presentation, she denied chest pain, lightheadedness, diaphoresis, headache, or dizziness. The initial vitals were blood pressure of 129/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, pulse rate of 75 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on room air. She was afebrile. The cardiopulmonary, neurologic, and musculoskeletal exam was unremarkable.

Ventricular fibrillation (VF) was noted on his arrival, and conventional CPR was performed immediately. He achieved ROSC after four defibrillation shocks, and was subsequently transferred to our hospital for post-cardiac arrest care. An intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) was inserted at our hospital for cardiogenic shock, and CAG was also performed, revealing total occlusion of his left anterior descending artery. He was diagnosed as having acute myocardial infarction and underwent successful PCI. Chest radiography did not reveal any traumatic abnormalities (Fig. ), and his hemodynamics were maintained using IABP and a continuous infusion of noradrenalin. Minimal change was observed in his Hb levels (admission, 13.5 g/dL; 6 hours later, 13.3 g/dL). Two days after admission, he suddenly deteriorated, and VA-ECMO was initiated for suspected cardiogenic shock. However, his Hb level decreased to 5.3 g/dL, which indicated hemorrhagic shock. Ultrasonography and chest radiography revealed massive left pleural effusion (Fig. ), and a massive hemothorax was diagnosed after inserting a chest drainage tube. The blood flow from the drainage tube was > 200 mL/hour for several hours, and contrast-enhanced CT was performed to identify the source of the bleeding. Contrast extravasation was noted behind his left sixth rib, as well as hematoma at his mediastinum and hemothorax without rib fracture (Fig. ). Thoracotomy was performed to achieve hemostasis 48 hours after cardiac arrest. Although the bleeding appeared to originate from his left ICA, it was difficult to stop; therefore, an artery involved with the adjacent rib was also ligated. However, this procedure did not stop the bleeding from the left chest drain, and angiography at 8 hours after the thoracotomy revealed bleeding from his left IMA. TAE was performed using microcoils and gelatin sponge pledgets, but did not control the bleeding. He subsequently died because of hemorrhagic shock 8 hours after the TAE.',\n",

He presented to MMTP in March 2006 with complaints of dyspnea, cough, throat irritation, and wheezing. He has a past medical history of pneumothorax, “cyst in the lung,” and arrhythmia. After 9/11, he developed sleep apnea (on continuous positive airway pressure). The patient is a nonsmoker.\\nPFTs are consistent with a mild restrictive and obstructive pattern, along with oxygen desaturation with exercise (97%–90%). His chest radiograph revealed nodules. HRCT (6 November 2006) revealed multiple small nodules (seven), prominent interstitial markings, and bronchiectasis. Lung biopsy showed interstitial fibrosis, mostly bronchiolocentric, with multiple patterns consistent with UIP, nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis (NSIP) [Supplemental Material, Figure 1F (doi:10.1289/ehp.0901159)], and hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Mineralogic analysis revealed CNT 3,450/g, silicates 165,600/g, and no asbestos fibers\\nAt a follow-up visit in 18 September 2009, the patient complained of shortness of breath, which remained unchanged, and worsening joint pain. His PFTs were FVC 86%, FEV1 80%, and DLCO 82%. The patient was referred to a rheumatologist, and standard tests for autoimmunity were negative. Oxygen desaturation is still present but has improved: 98%–93%. CT scan of the chest shows mild worsening of the interstitial markings. Bronchiectasis and nodules are unchanged.',\n",

The patient underwent the first surgery at the Neurosurgery Clinic in November 2005 due to the diagnosed diffuse astrocytoma. The second surgery was performed in August 2008, and an inspection of a sample of tumor tissue showed that it was a recurrence of a diffuse astrocytoma. Afterwards, the girl underwent regular checkups and was evaluated on the basis of the findings of MRI that was performed on several occasions after the last surgery. In the early 2010, the patient’s condition worsened. She had a few epileptic seizures, and she was showing signs of sleepiness and had trouble concentrating. On 26 March 2010, an urgent MRI was performed, and it showed a massive recurrence of glial tumor measuring 70 ×60 × 50 mm (Fig. ).\\nMeanwhile, there was a sudden deterioration of consciousness of the patient which progressed to the stage of coma caused by spontaneous bleeding from a pathological process in the brain, which is why on the patient underwent an emergency surgery 01 April 2010, during which a left-side decompression parietal-temporal-occipital craniotomy, evacuation of hematoma, and the reduction of an expansive process were performed. As the postoperative CT scan of the brain showed the persistence of cerebral edema and the expansive process, a decompression re-craniotomy and an additional resection of the expansive process were performed. After this procedure, the second control postoperative CT was performed, and since the findings were satisfactory, the girl was awakened and taken off the controlled mechanical ventilation.\\nOn 14 April 2010, the patient underwent a new surgical procedure in terms of the maximum reduction of the tumor mass. The samples of tumor tissue were sent for intraoperative analysis, and later to detailed histopathological analysis. After the analysis of the samples obtained, it was concluded that it was a highly anaplastic glial tumor with an expressed vascular proliferation and larger areas of focal hemorrhagic necrosis. A very high mitotic activity was observed within the tumor. In the tumor portion along the necrosis margins, an abundance of foam cells and hemosiderophages, as well as gliosis, was found. From the aspect of immunocytochemistry, 20% of tumor cells gave a positive response to p53. The final diagnosis was glioblastoma multiforme (GBM).\\nIn late April 2010, the patient started to use herbal medicine. The StPT combination was introduced, and she used it in the course of following 33 months.\\nBetween 17 May 2010 and 23 June 2010, the girl was hospitalized at the radiology ward, where 3D conformal radiotherapy of the brain tumor (glioblastoma multiforme) in the left parietal-temporal-occipital region of the brain was performed by using a linear accelerator with a power of 6 MW. A therapeutic dose of 56 Gy was administered in 28 fractions, along with the accompanying therapy with temozolomid (TMZ) capsules of 75 mg/m2 of body surface area. During therapy, nausea and occasional vomiting occurred once a day, which was put under control by antiemetics. She was discharged in a good general condition. In addition to radiation therapy and the therapy with TMZ, the patient also used herbal medicine. After completion of the combined radio and chemotherapy (RT/CT), the patient underwent no further oncological treatment but continued with PT. As a medical treatment, she used antiepileptic drugs and a dexamethasone dose of 4 mg/day. In September 2010, a control scan was performed which showed the presence of tumor residues, dimensions 8 × 6 mm (Fig. ). In this period, a significant reduction of brain edema volume occurred; furthermore, alongside PT, the patient kept using antiepileptic drugs only. During this period, there had been a significant reduction of the volume of cerebral edema, so the patient, in addition to PT, continued taking only antiepileptic drugs. The control nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI) performed on 23 December 2010 (Fig. ) showed that the tumor was approximately the same dimensions as on the previous scans. The following control scans showed continuous tumor regression. The NMRI performed on 17 May 2011 (Fig. ) showed that the tumor dimensions were 8 × 4 mm, and the scan performed on 20 September 2011 (Fig. ) showed that the tumor dimensions were 7 × 2 mm. The disappearance of the tumor was determined by a control scan on 19 September 2012 (Fig. ), and NMRIs performed on 25 February 2013 (Fig. ) and 11 March 2014 (Fig. ) showed no radiological signs of a tumor. The patient used phytotherapy for 27 months with full capacity and without breaks, as long as radiological signs of the tumor were present.

       "        'A 55 year old, white female had Type II diabetes, hypothyroidism, hypertension with history of ACEI cough, persistent mild allergic rhinitis with seasonal worsening to moderate levels, and chronic moderate persistent asthma. After starting sitagliptin 100 mg by mouth daily, she developed severe rhinorrhea and cough which persisted for months.\\nWhen she returned for follow-up, her PEFR was 176 L/min. Her FEV1/FVC was 63% and FEF25%-75% was 43% of predicted. Sitagliptin was stopped. She scored her postnasal drip as 3/10 two days after stopping the drug. The cough resolved over several days and her PEFR rose to 280 L/min after 12 days.\\nLater, she asked to restart sitagliptin because of the beneficial hypoglycaemic benefits. Unfortunately, this was during her typical tree pollen-induced rhinitis period. PEFR dropped to 180 L/min and rhinorrhea scores increased to 9/10 despite the concomitant, but intermittent, use of inhaled steroids and bronchodilators. Cough did not recur, but she stopped the sitagliptin because of dyspnea. Dyspnea resolved within one day, and rhinorrhea in 2 days (0/10). Two weeks later, her FEV1/FVC had increased to 79.1%, FEF25%-75% to 69% of predicted, and PEFR to 320 L/min. The next year while off sitagliptin, her maximum rhinorrhea score during the tree pollen season was 5/10.\\nFatigue at the end of her first sitagliptin treatment period was 7/10. This dropped to 4/10 after stopping the drug. During the challenge period, her fatigue again reached 7/10. Fatigue decreased to 3/10 within 3 days of stopping the sitagliptin challenge, and remained low throughout her tree pollen rhinitis season.',\n",
